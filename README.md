# BTHOWeN_WNN-IDS
A Weightless Neural Network (WNN) for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This work aims to improve recent results obtained by applying WiSARD Networks to the problem of intrusion detection. By using Bloom WiSARD as well as BTHOWeN, this study's goal is to provide a zero-shot learning alternative with competitive inference time and accuracy.
